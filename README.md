# Weather Forecast Application

**Description:**

This project builds a robust and interactive web application that leverages the strengths of Streamlit, FastAPI, and a **built-in** machine learning model to accurately predict weather variables for a specified location and time frame.

**Key Features:**

- **Integrated Machine Learning:** Includes a trained weather prediction model within the project, eliminating the need for external resources.
- **Streamlined Data Flow:** FastAPI provides a RESTful API framework to efficiently manage data flow and model interactions.
- **Intuitive Interface:** Streamlit's user-friendly interface allows users to input location and time frame parameters effortlessly.
- **Clear Visualizations:** Streamlit's versatile plotting capabilities create informative visualizations of predicted weather variables.
